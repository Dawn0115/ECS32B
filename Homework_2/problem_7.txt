Linear search:
there is only one for loop to iterate the entire array.
the best case of linear search is the target is in the first place. O(1)
average case of linear search is O(n)
Worst case is we have to go through the whole array. O(n)


Binary search:
the bese case of binary search is also the target in the first place. O(1)
the average and worst case is O(log n)(log is base two)
