3.(b)

(i): if it is complete graph,the each node in adjacency list can link to every other nodes in the graph. 
Furthemore, there will be n-1 links in each row in adjacency list, which n is the total number of vertexes.

(ii): if there is a loop in graph, this means the corresponding node can link to it self. So, there will be one more 
link to itself in the corresponding row of adjacency list.

(iii) If the graph has an isolated vertex, this means, the row of that isolated vertex in adjacency list will be empty.
Because it doesn't connect to anyone vertext.
