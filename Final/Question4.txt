(a):
the structure of a complete binary tree with maximum number of nodes is every nodes in this tree will have two childrens
except the leaf node, until this tree reaches the height. After that, the number of nodes in this tree should be
2^h -1. Because at each level i, ther are 2^(i-1) nodes in that level. After adding up all nodes in each level, we come 
up with the formula of total number of nodes in this tree which is n=2^h - 1.

(b):
the structure of a complete binary tree with minimum number of nodes is every nodes are locating in the same direction 
of the root node, stop adding nodes when it reaches heigh h. Then the number of node is h.
The formula of the minimum number of node a complete binary tree could contain is n=h

(c):
from (a) we know the Max number of node is n= 2^h -1
solving it, h = log(n+1)[base 2]
from (b) we know the Min number of nodes is n=h
h=n
