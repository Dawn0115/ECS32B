for this question to make this linked list to a double linked list. we have to add another implementation in Node class. we can define self.prev = None at first
then we cna access to the specific node by change the nexe and previous node of it. We also have to modify each small cuntion in Linkedlist Class. add self.prev 
to them.
Here is small example
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None

then modify other funcition in class
